# Introduction

```goal
Welcome to the documentation of the ALICE O2 analysis framework
```

Here we describe the fundamental concepts of a run 3 analysis: AO2D files, analysis tasks, analysis workflow, the data model, the hyperloop train system and give pointers to tutorials and helper tasks.

O2 support happens on Mattermost. Therefore, please login to [Mattermost](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch) and (if not already done) join the restricted team ALICE. Then join the support channels on Mattermost: [O2 Analysis](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-analysis) and [O2 Hyperloop Operation](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-hyperloop-operation).
