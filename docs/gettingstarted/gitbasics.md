# Git basics

Git is a version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

Developers can review project history to find out:

- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes?
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?

An introduction to Git can be be found within the [Git-Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git).

Within the documentation there is an overview about:
- About Git
- Pushing commits to a remote repository
- Getting changes from a remote repository
- Dealing with non-fast-forward errors
- Splitting a subfolder out into a new repository
- About Git subtree merges
- About Git rebase
- Using Git rebase on the command line
- Resolving merge conflicts after a Git rebase
- Dealing with special characters in branch and tag names
