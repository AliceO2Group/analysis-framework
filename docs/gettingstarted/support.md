## Support venues

The primary venue for support is Mattermost. Please login to [Mattermost](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch) and join the restricted team ALICE (top menu, select join restricted teams).
You should then join the following support channels on Mattermost:

- [O2 Analysis](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-analysis) - meant for general support. Please feel free to write here!
- [O2 Analysis Announcements](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-analysis-announcements) - meant for announcements that impact everyone.
- [O2 Hyperloop Operation](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-hyperloop-operation) - meant to bookkeep Hyperloop operational information and train requests.

A legacy support venue is the alice project analysis task force mailing list: [alice-project-analysis-task-force@cern.ch](mailto:alice-project-analysis-task-force@cern.ch).
