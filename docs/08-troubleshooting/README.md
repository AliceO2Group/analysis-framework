# Support and troubleshooting

The primary venue for support is Mattermost. Please login to [Mattermost](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch) and join the restricted team ALICE (top menu, select join restricted teams). You should then join the following support channels on Mattermost: 

- [O2 Analysis](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-analysis): meant for general support. Please feel free to write here! 
- [O2 Analysis Announcements](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-analysis-announcements): meant for announcements that impact everyone. 
- [O2 Hyperloop Operation](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/alice/channels/o2-hyperloop-operation): meant to bookkeep hyperloop operational information and train requests.

A legacy support venue is the alice project analysis task force mailing list: <a href="mailto:alice-project-analysis-task-force@cern.ch">alice-project-analysis-task-force@cern.ch</a>.
